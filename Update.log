<>#Whoops! Forgot to update this!

At the time of writing this, the game has been undergoing a full rewrite in code since 10/19/2025. It is being done due to how all over the place the current code is. It will hopefully fix many bugs, and add new things alongside it. Such as...
- Melee and gun combat overhaul (combo attacks getting replaced with light and heavy attacks, you'll now be able to ADS and pistol whip with guns) 
- Shops (in the lobby and ingame during runs)
- Charms (several charms that can range from increasing a stat to changing how the game is played)
- Metacurrency (an incentive to keep you guys going)
- Origin skins (will apply to origin character and origin accessories)
- And more!
